PROJECT: SIMPLE MARIO-LIKE PLATFORMER IN THE BROWSER

GOAL
- Build a very simple 2D platformer that *feels* a bit like Super Mario Bros.
- It runs in the browser using ONLY:
  - HTML + CSS
  - JavaScript
  - HTML5 <canvas>
- The main purpose is for me to learn how to code while building a real game.
- Priority: keep everything very simple and understandable for a beginner.

MY LEVEL
- I do NOT know how to code yet.
- I’m okay with reading code if it’s explained clearly with comments.
- I want small, incremental changes, not huge rewrites.
- I prefer vanilla JavaScript, no bundlers, frameworks or libraries.

TECH SETUP
- Project folder has:
  - index.html
  - main.js
- index.html:
  - Contains a <canvas id="game" width="800" height="400"></canvas>
  - Loads main.js with <script src="main.js"></script>
  - Basic styles (border around the canvas and a background color)
- main.js:
  - Gets the canvas and 2D context:
    - const canvas = document.getElementById("game");
    - const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  - Tracks keyboard input with keydown/keyup listeners (ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, ArrowUp and/or Space).
  - Has a player object something like:
    - x, y, width, height
    - vx, vy (velocity)
    - speed
    - jumpStrength
    - onGround (boolean)
  - Has gravity (e.g. gravity = 0.5) and a groundY line (e.g. 350).
  - update() does:
    - horizontal movement left/right using keys and player.speed
    - jump when key is pressed AND player.onGround is true
    - apply gravity (vy += gravity) and then apply velocity to x and y
    - simple ground collision so player stops at groundY and onGround becomes true
  - draw() does:
    - clear the canvas
    - draw the ground as a simple rectangle
    - draw the player as a simple red rectangle
  - loop():
    - calls update() and draw()
    - uses requestAnimationFrame(loop)
  - loop() is called once at the bottom to start the game.

CURRENT STATE
- The basic game loop is working.
- The player:
  - appears on screen,
  - can move left/right with the arrow keys,
  - can jump and land on the ground.
- If some of this is missing in my actual code, FIRST help me refactor main.js so it matches this design in a clean and simple way, THEN build new features.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR HELPING ME
- Always keep the code simple and beginner-friendly.
- Add comments in plain language for any new logic.
- Make small, focused changes instead of rewrites.
- Before changing large parts of the file, explain what you’ll change and why.
- After writing code, add a short explanation of what you did, in simple words.

FEATURE ROADMAP (NEXT STEPS)
LEVEL 1 (DONE or NEARLY DONE)
- Basic movement and jump
- Gravity + ground collision
- Simple game loop with update() and draw()

LEVEL 2 (NOW)
- Keep player inside the canvas horizontally
- Add at least one floating platform (a rectangle) that the player can land on
- Simple collision with that platform (only from above is fine)

LEVEL 3 (LATER)
- Camera that follows the player horizontally
- Level made of multiple platforms defined in an array (like basic tiles)
- Simple collectibles (coins) or enemies that move back and forth

LEVEL 4 (MUCH LATER)
- Replace rectangles with simple sprites
- Add basic sounds
- Start/restart screen, basic UI

HOW I WANT YOU (CURSOR) TO RESPOND
- When I select a part of the code and ask for a change, modify ONLY what’s needed.
- When you add or change code, explain:
  - what you changed,
  - why you changed it,
  - where I should look to understand it.
- Prefer code that is explicit and easy to read over "clever" code.
- Never introduce extra tools (no npm, no bundlers, no frameworks) unless I explicitly ask.
